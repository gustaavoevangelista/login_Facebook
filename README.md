# login_Facebook
## Project description
  In this project I will recreate the facebook login page using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and 
  save the data in a database (mySQL).


## Goal
  The goal of this project was to connect the front-end and the back-end. During the process, I had to use 
  an API to be the middleware for security reasons. 

## The project
  You have the home page to login or to sign up.

  First you have to sign up in order to login:

  If you filled all fields and the passwords match, an alert will come up and you will be redirected to your "feed" page:

 ## Back-end
   The back-end was built with the contribution of my colleagues Luiz Contes and Amjed Omar.
   
   The data is catch when we are singing up. When we click the button, the data is sent to Fetch API and saved in database.
   
   When logging in, the data is fetch on database through the API, if the data is found, you are able to log in.
